    Determining the knowledge captured by pretrained language models is an
    important challenge, and is commonly tackled by probing model
    representations using classifiers.  However, it is difficult to design
    probes for semantic knowledge such as facts or textual entailment.
    Reformulating these semantic tasks as cloze tests (i.e., fill-in-the-blank
    problems) is a promising method for probing such knowledge, but, requires
    manual crafting of textual prompts to elicit this knowledge, limiting its
    use.  In this paper, we develop an automated, task-agnostic method to
    create cloze prompts for any classification task, based on a
    gradient-guided search.  We find prompts that demonstrate MLMs have an
    inherent capability to perform sentiment analysis and natural language
    inference, and without any finetuning, sometimes achieve performance on-par
    with recent state-of-the-art supervised models.  We also show that our
    prompts elicit more accurate factual knowledge from MLMs compared to manual
    prompts, and further, MLMs can be used as relation extractors out of the
    box, when prompted with suitable prompts, more effectively than recent
    supervised RE models.

    The ongoing pandemic has heightened the need for developing tools to flag
    COVID-19-related misinformation on the internet, specifically on social
    media such as Twitter. However, due to novel language and the rapid change
    of information, existing misinformation detection datasets are not
    effective in evaluating systems designed to detect misinformation on this
    topic. Misinformation detection can be subdivided into two sub-tasks -
    retrieval of misconceptions relevant to posts being checked for veracity,
    and stance detection to identify whether the posts agree, disagree, or
    express no stance towards the retrieved misconceptions. To facilitate
    research on this task, we release COVID-Lies, a dataset of 5K
    expert-annotated tweets to evaluate the performance of misinformation
    detection systems on 86 different pieces of COVID-19 related
    misinformation. We evaluate existing NLP systems on this dataset, providing
    first benchmarks and identifying key challenges for future models to
    improve upon.

    Language models that use additional latent structures (e.g., syntax trees,
    coreference chains, knowledge graph links) provide several advantages over
    traditional language models. However, likelihood-based evaluation of these
    models is often intractable as it requires marginalizing over the latent
    space. Existing works avoid this issue by using importance sampling. Although
    this approach has asymptotic guarantees, analysis is rarely conducted on the
    effect of decisions such as sample size and choice of proposal distribution
    on the reported estimates. In this paper, we carry out this analysis for
    three models: RNNG, EntityNLM, and KGLM. In addition, we elucidate subtle
    differences in how importance sampling is applied in these works that can
    have substantial effects on the final estimates, as well as provide
    theoretical results which reinforce the validity of this technique.

    Amid electronic health records, laboratory tests, and other technology,
    office-based patient and provider communication is still the heart of
    primary medical care. Patients typically present multiple complaints,
    requiring physicians to decide how to balance competing demands. How this
    time is allocated has implications for patient satisfaction, payments, and
    quality of care. We investigate the effectiveness of machine learning
    methods for automated annotation of medical topics in patient-provider
    dialog transcripts.
    We used dialog transcripts from 279 primary care visits to predict
    talk-turn topic labels. Different machine learning models were trained to
    operate on single or multiple local talk-turns (logistic classifiers,
    support vector machines, gated recurrent units) as well as sequential
    models that integrate information across talk-turn sequences (conditional
    random fields, hidden Markov models, and hierarchical gated recurrent
    units).
    Evaluation was performed using cross-validation to measure 1)
    classification accuracy for talk-turns and 2) precision, recall, and F1
    scores at the visit level. Experimental results showed that sequential
    models had higher classification accuracy at the talk-turn level and higher
    precision at the visit level. Independent models had higher recall scores
    at the visit level compared with sequential models.
    Incorporating sequential information across talk-turns improves the
    accuracy of topic prediction in patient-provider dialog by smoothing out
    noisy information from talk-turns. Although the results are promising, more
    advanced prediction techniques and larger labeled datasets will likely be
    required to achieve prediction performance appropriate for real-world
    clinical applications.

      Contextual word representations, typically trained on unstructured,
      unlabeled text, do not contain any explicit grounding to real world
      entities and are often unable to remember facts about those entities. We
      propose a general method to embed multiple knowledge bases (KBs) into
      large scale models, and thereby enhance their representations with
      structured, human-curated knowledge. For each KB, we first use an
      integrated entity linker to retrieve relevant entity embeddings, then
      update contextual word representations via a form of word-to-entity
      attention. In contrast to previous approaches, the entity linkers and
      self-supervised language modeling objective are jointly trained
      end-to-end in a multitask setting that combines a small amount of entity
      linking supervision with a large amount of raw text. After integrating
      WordNet and a subset of Wikipedia into BERT, the knowledge enhanced BERT
      (KnowBert) demonstrates improved perplexity, ability to recall facts as
      measured in a probing task and downstream performance on relationship
      extraction, entity typing, and word sense disambiguation. KnowBert’s
      runtime is comparable to BERT’s and it scales to large KBs.

    Modeling human language requires the ability to not only generate fluent text but also encode factual knowledge.
    However, traditional language models are only capable of remembering facts seen at training time, and often have difficulty recalling them.
    To address this, we introduce the knowledge graph language model (KGLM), a neural language model with mechanisms for selecting and copying facts from a knowledge graph that are relevant to the context.
    These mechanisms enable the model to render information it has never seen before, as well as generate out-of-vocabulary tokens.
    We also introduce the Linked WikiText-2 dataset, a corpus of annotated text aligned to the Wikidata knowledge graph whose contents (roughly) match the popular WikiText-2 benchmark.
    In experiments, we demonstrate that the KGLM achieves significantly better performance than a strong baseline language model.
    We additionally compare different language model's ability to complete sentences requiring factual knowledge, showing that the KGLM outperforms even very large language models in generating facts.

    There is an increasing need for accurate quantitative assessment of the performance of prediction models (such as deep neural networks), out-of-sample, e.g., in new environments after they have been trained.
    In this context we propose a Bayesian framework for assessing performance characteristics of black-box classifiers, performing inference on quantities such as accuracy and calibration bias.
    We demonstrate the approach using three deep neural networks applied to large real-world data sets, performing inference and active learning to assess class-specific performance.

      We introduce entity post-modifier generation as an instance of a collaborative writing task.
      Given a sentence about a target entity, the task is to automatically generate a post-modifier phrase that provides contextually relevant information about the entity.
      For example, for the sentence, "Barack Obama, _______, supported the \#MeToo movement.", the phrase "a father of two girls" is a contextually relevant post-modifier.
      To this end, we build PoMo, a post-modifier dataset created automatically from news articles reflecting a journalistic need for incorporating entity information that is relevant to a particular news event.
      PoMo consists of more than 231K sentences with post-modifiers and associated facts extracted from Wikidata for around 57K unique entities.
      We use crowdsourcing to show that modeling contextual relevance is necessary for accurate post-modifier generation.
      We adapt a number of existing generation approaches as baselines for this dataset.
      Our results show there is large room for improvement in terms of both identifying relevant facts to include (knowing which claims are relevant gives a >20% improvement in BLEU score), and generating appropriate post-modifier text for the context (providing relevant claims is not sufficient for accurate generation).
      We conduct an error analysis that suggests promising directions for future research.

      The broad goal of information extraction is to derive structured
      information from unstructured data. However, most existing methods focus
      solely on text, ignoring other types of unstructured data such as images,
      video and audio which comprise an increasing portion of the information
      on the web. To address this shortcoming, we propose the task of
      multimodal attribute extraction. Given a collection of unstructured and
      semi-structured contextual information about an entity (such as a textual
      description, or visual depictions) the task is to extract the entity's
      underlying attributes. In this paper, we provide a dataset containing
      mixed-media data for over 2 million product items along with 7 million
      attribute-value pairs describing the items which can be used to train
      attribute extractors in a weakly supervised manner. We provide a variety
      of baselines which demonstrate the relative effectiveness of the
      individual modes of information towards solving the task, as well as
      study human performance.

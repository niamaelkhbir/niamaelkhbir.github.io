    There are two main paradigms for Named Entity Recognition (NER): sequence labelling
    and span classification. Sequence labelling aims to assign a label to each word in
    an input text using, for example, BIO (Begin, Inside and Outside) tagging, while span
    classification involves enumerating all possible spans in a text and classifying them 
    into their labels. In contrast to sequence labelling, unconstrained span-based methods
    tend to assign entity labels to overlapping spans, which is generally undesirable,
    especially for NER tasks without nested entities. Accordingly, we propose GNNer, a
    framework that uses Graph Neural Networks to enrich the span representation to reduce
    the number of overlapping spans during prediction. Our approach reduces the number of
    overlapping spans compared to strong baseline while maintaining competitive metric
    performance. Code is available at https://github.com/urchade/GNNer.

    The automation of taxonomy construction has increased in popularity recently. Such an interest for the domain
    has been motivated by the large number of new scientific papers published each year that implies a growing
    difficulty in following the new topics of the different scientific domains and their importance in the topic
    hierarchy. In this paper, we propose a way to automatically construct topic taxonomies from millions of scientific
    article abstracts and ways to automatically evaluate this construction. While, to our knowledge, other approaches
    rely on pipelines of models and human evaluation to validate them, we chose to rely on simple models that are
    easier to evaluate automatically and, thus, promote the improvement of our models thanks to a large number of 
    iterations. The contribution of this paper is threefold: 1) the proposition of a new method to construct taxonomies
    from a large set of scientific papers, 2) a method to precompile taxonomy information into matrices that will be
    quickly queried, and 3) an objective method to automatically evaluate the constructed taxonomies without requiring
    human evaluation.
